## 🧩 How to Choose Which Use Cases Fit Your SMB — A Simple Framework

- **Start by identifying pain points** — repetitive tasks, slow response times, manual workflows, lack of data insights.  
- **Prioritize high-impact, frequent tasks** — tasks done often or that take significant time are better candidates.  
- **Estimate resource savings & ROI** — time saved, error reduction, increased sales or customer satisfaction.  
- **Consider complexity & tools** — begin with simpler use cases (chatbots, marketing automation, admin tasks), then scale to advanced ones (analytics, demand forecasting).  
- **Measure results & iterate** — track KPIs (response time, leads, conversion, errors, cost per task) and refine your automation setup over time.
